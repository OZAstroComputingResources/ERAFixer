# ERAFixer
Script to parse and clean up ERA codes for Faculty of Science and Engineering

This script was created to assist in the assignment of ERA codes to the faculty papers. It is designed to be used both interactively and in an iterative fashion

For examples see the [notebook](https://github.com/OZAstroComputingResources/ERAFixer/blob/master/ERAFixer%20Examples.ipynb). (Note that this requires an appropriate excel spreadsheet)
